I was Google Summer of Code (2018) Student Developer for [FOSSASIA](https://fossasia.org/). I spend summer working on [SUSI.AI iOS](https://github.com/fossasia/susi_iOS) project. During GSoC period, I have written weekly blogs about the features implemented by me. You can find all the blogs in links below. These blogs are originally published on [FOSSASIA Blogs](https://blog.fossasia.org/author/imjog/) website.

 **Closing Notes**

 Initially it was hard writing blogs but after writing some blogs, it's got easier. Google Summer of Code is not all about the code, it is about communication, team work, documentations, scrums, meetups. The GSoC journey was fun indeed.
 If you have any query regarding my GSoC project or GSoC in general, feel free to reach me out :)
