description: "OpenTender is a decentralized application which allows different organizations, such as government, to release tenders. OpenTender prevents organizations from tampering or looking into the proposed amount of the contracts submitted by various contractors, for a given tender under a fixed deadline. OpenTender brings fairness and decentralization in the end-to-end process of tenders."
